# Guide to Montreal

## Food

**Kazu**,[ 1862 Ste-Catherine Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=1862+Ste-Catherine+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

* MUST GO - by my reckoning, the best quality to price ratio I’ve ever found in a restaurant

* Weird, tiny restaurant run by a cheerful, tiny Japanese man in a bright yellow shirt (the eponymous Kazu)

* Time your arrival right - try to show up at the beginning of service (or near the end), or you will wait on a long line -- you may still have to wait on a short line, but it's 100% worth it

* Limit yourself to groups of 4 or fewer

* Enjoy the envious stares of people still waiting in the cold while you're stuffing your face full of delicious flavor

* Try the plum wine or homemade ice cream for dessert -- I recommend Green Tea or Sparkling Maple

* About $13-25CAD/dish 

**Au Pied de Cochon**, [536 Ave. Duluth E](https://maps.google.com/?q=536+Ave.+Duluth+E&entry=gmail&source=g).

* Very Montréal gustatory adventure from Québec chef Martin Picard

* Over-the-top decadant takes on traditional Québecois dishes. Huge portions. This place is infamous.

* Pretty expensive @ $15-40 CAD/dish

**Toque,** [900 Jean Paul Riopelle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toqu%C3%A9!/@45.502948,-73.5633926,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91a5a5bcf3cf9:0xbc597e7aa83a3a3!8m2!3d45.502948!4d-73.561204)

* Long-considered one of Montreal’s finest restaurants

* Very expensive, but very, very good.

**Fung Shing**, [1102 Boul. St Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=1102+Boul.+St+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g) 

* Chinese restaurant  "hole in the wall"

* we love the treasure bean curd, hot and sour soup, and crispy chicken (1/2 can be ordered)

**Larrys**,[ 9 Fairmount Ave Est](https://maps.google.com/?q=9+Fairmount+Ave+Est&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Nice little cafe/bar in the plateau that serves great food

**Rotisseri Romados**, [115 rue Rachel Est](https://maps.google.com/?q=115+rue+Rachel+Est&entry=gmail&source=g)

* The plateau is full of Portuguese restaurants, especially chicken places. This is the best one

* Very cheap, fast service

**Patati Patata**, [4177 Boul St-Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=4177+Boul+St-Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Cheap & delicious tiny hole-in-the-wall that serves traditional quebec junk food. Expect to wait in line during peak hours

**Ganadera**, [1862 de Maisonneuve Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=1862+de+Maisonneuve+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Korean restaurant in the Concordia University area. Cheap and really good.

**Antep Kebab**, [1626 de Maisonneuve Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=1626+de+Maisonneuve+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Quick, cheap & good Turkish sandwich shop in the Concordia/Guy metro area.

**Nulifar**, [1923 Ste-Catherine Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=1923+Ste-Catherine+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Another quick, cheap & delicious Guy/Concordia area option. Lebanese food.

**My Cahn**, [1086 Boul St. Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=1086+Boul+St.+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Fantastic Pho place in chinatown

**The Main**, [3864 Boul. St. Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=3864+Boul.+St.+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g)

* A Montreal cultural experience! 

* Taste the famous Montreal smoked meat (in sandwich form or on its own) at Schwartz's (the famous and tourist-filled one) or The Main (the less famous but equally delicious one with no line)

* Get a Medium smoked meat sandwich (medium refers to the amount of fattiness)

* Get the smoked meat poutine, the gravy is amazing, ask for extra cheese if your budget can spare it

* $10-15CAD/dish 

**Schwartz's**, [3895 Boul. St. Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=3895+Boul.+St.+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g)

* This is a tourist stop and a fantastic smoked meat deli but our family prefers The Main which is across the street.

**Joe Beef**, [2491 rue Notre Dame Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=2491+rue+Notre+Dame+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g), 514-935-6504

* Located in "Little Burgundy", this restaurant serves wonderful food, it has broad acclaim but it is rather pricey. You will need reservations.

**Le Vin Papillon**, [2519 rue Notre Dame Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=2519+rue+Notre+Dame+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Same owner as Joe Beef, and also somewhat pricey. Just down the street.

**Qing Hua**, [1676 Ave Lincoln](https://maps.google.com/?q=1676+Ave+Lincoln&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Chinese soup dumplings place located downtown, a good choice for tasty, cheap meal

**Yokato Yokabai Ramen**, [4185 Drolet](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yokato+Yokabai+Ramen/@45.5212477,-73.5807153,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91bcdce6fef43:0xb9d59a5426dbb271!8m2!3d45.5212477!4d-73.5785266)

* Great ramen place in the plateau. Karaage chicken is also delicious

* $11-15CAD for a giant bowl of warm, comforting deliciousness 

**Le Quartier Général**, [1251 rue Gilford](https://maps.google.com/?q=1251+rue+Gilford&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Area sourced food Québécois cuisine. Good, but not cheap--medium to expensive.

**Desserts**:

**Juliette & Chocolat,** [3600 Boul. St Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=3600+Boul.+St+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g), and other locations

I love this place, there are several locations in Montreal and, if you're in the mood for a dessert, this is a great choice.

**Cacao 70**, [2087 Sainte-Catherine Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=2087+Sainte-Catherine+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g)

This has a warm, rustic urban café ambiance, the desserts are amazing tasting and amazing looking. I would definitely encourage you to stop here. It is downtown near the Guy metro area.

**Bagels**:

Many Montrealers believe that their bagels are superior to NY bagels. They are very different (denser and sweeter) and I recommend you try them fresh out of the oven with sesame seeds.

* Don't expect to eat them piled high with toppings, like its NY cousin. The Montreal Bagel is a different beast altogether

* Best eaten straight out of the bag, just as they are. Toasted with a little butter or cream cheese and lox is acceptable for day-olds

* Freeze the extras for future nomming

* 1 dozen for $7

There are basically two places near each other that compete for the "best Montreal bagel" crown:

**Fairmount Bagels**, [74 Ave Fairmount Ouest](https://maps.google.com/?q=74+Ave+Fairmount+Ouest&entry=gmail&source=g), open 24 hours

**St-Viateur**, [263 rue St-Viateur](https://maps.google.com/?q=St-Viateur,+263+rue+St-Viateur&entry=gmail&source=g), open 24 hours

**Markets**:

**Marché Jean Talon**, [7070 Ave Henri Julien](https://maps.google.com/?q=7070+Ave+Henri+Julien&entry=gmail&source=g)

* This is a large open air market where you'll find meats, vegetables, fruit, maple syrup, cheeses etc.

**Marché Atwater**, [138 Atwater Ave](https://maps.google.com/?q=138+Atwater+Ave&entry=gmail&source=g)

* This is similar to the Jean-Talon Market, but at the opposite end of the city.

## Breweries/Craft Beers

**Dieu Du Ciel**, [29 Laurier Avenue](https://maps.google.com/?q=29+Laurier+Avenue&entry=gmail&source=g)

* A must for micro-brew-lovers -- delicious seasonal beers in a homey pub atmosphere.

* Considered one of the best breweries in the world, they often experiment with recipes and test them out here at their home bar, so you can try things that aren’t available anywhere else in the world!

* Their *Moralité *IPA, *Aphrodisiaque *black ale, and *Péché Mortel* (Mortal Sin) stout are all rated 100 on ratebeer, and plus the names are super cool!

* The food isn’t great. The beer is the star.

**Isle de Garde**, [1039 rue Beaubien Est](https://maps.google.com/?q=1039+rue+Beaubien+Est&entry=gmail&source=g)

**Réservoir**, [9 Ave Duluth Est](https://maps.google.com/?q=9+Ave+Duluth+Est&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Also serves good vegetarian food

**Cheval Blanc**, [809 Ontario Est](https://maps.google.com/?q=809+Ontario+Est&entry=gmail&source=g)

**Vices & Versa**, [6631 Boul. St Laurent](https://maps.google.com/?q=6631+Boul.+St+Laurent&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Great selection of Quebec beers and other assorted intrigues (alcoholized Kombucha, etc.)

* Very nice "classy neighborhood bar" ambiance, with an adorable terrace

* Food is solid but not spectacular, around $10-15CAD/dish

**Le Saint-Brock,** [1749 rue St-Denis](https://maps.google.com/?q=1749%C2%A0rue+St-Denis&entry=gmail&source=g)

* Massive selection of interesting beer (I think they have 50 on tap any given night, plus their "Bible" of bottles)

* Mix of their own brews, other Quebec beers and imports

* Pints around $8-9CAD
